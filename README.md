# f-board

f-board is a progressive web app that helps you to recognize note patterns on your string instrument. It's designed to be flexible, intuitive to use, and mobile friendly.

It's perfect for those who are learning a new instrument or experimenting with new tunings. You can choose from five instrument templates, add and remove strings, and tune each string freely. You can also toggle between sharps and flats and disable sounds.

Then you can select any note combinations that you are practicing by simply clicking or tapping them on the board.
